# readMeGenerator 1.0

## Description
I created this application to aid in laying out professional README files, to make work more efficient.
I built this project so that I could, in the future, create professional READMEs in minutes.
This project solves the exact thing I am doing now, taking so much time to create a README.
I learned a lot about how node.js can change things on the computer, and how quickly it can brick a computer if youre not careful :/
